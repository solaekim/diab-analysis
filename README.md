# Data Analysis for Diabetes Prediction
## Project Overview
This project focuses on independently mastering data analysis techniques by developing a diabetes prediction model using publicly available data.

Leveraging Python and machine learning methodologies, I will preprocess and scale the data, then train predictive models to accurately identify risk patterns.

The project also involves in-depth data analysis, system optimization, and performance evaluation to deepen my understanding of practical algorithm implementation and its real-world potential.

Ultimately, this endeavor aims to expand my knowledge of computer science by aligning with current technological trends and exploring technologies that serve the public good.
